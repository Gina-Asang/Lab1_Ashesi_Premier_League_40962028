Program Description:

  This program serves like a prototype of a Football Player Management System
  designed for the Ashesi Premier League. It integrates multiple core Java concepts
  into a single application, serving as a "Team Selection Simulator"
  for coaches.

  The program starts by collecting player details from the user:
   Name, Age,Height (in meters, converted to centimeters),
   Weight(in pounds, converted to kilograms), Jersey Number

 After gathering the details, the program performs several operations:
1. Player Categorization:
    - Players under 20 years are categorized as "Rising Star".
    - Players between 20 and 30 years are "Prime Player".
    - Players over 30 years are "Veteran".
2. Position Assignment:
   - Based on the jersey number, the program assigns a football
    position (e.g., 1 = Goalkeeper, 9 = Striker, etc.).
    - If the jersey number does not match any known position,
    "Player position not known" is displayed.
3. Attacker Identification:
  - Some jersey numbers (like 7, 9, 10, 11) are considered attacker
    numbers. The program checks whether the playerâ€™s jersey belongs
     to an attacker.
 4. Eligibility Check:
 - A player is eligible to play if: Age is at least 18 but not above 35
 and Weight is less than 90 kg.
 Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to evaluate this condition.
5. Lineup Decision (Nested If):
 - If a player is a "Prime Player" and has weight less than 80 kg,
they are placed in the "Starting Lineup" else "Bench"
6. Final Decision (Ternary Operator):
 - The program quickly decides whether the player will "Play"
 or "Rest" based on their eligibility status using the ternary operator.
7. Switch Demonstration:
 - The program demonstrates the effect of switch-case without
        breaks (fall-through).
 - It also shows how grouping cases together avoids repetition.

 Finally, the program prints a structured Player Report that
 summarizes all the decisions:

        Player: [Name]
        Age: [Age] ([Category])
        Height: [cm]
        Weight: [kg]
        Jersey: [number]
        Position: [Position]
        Attacker jersey: [Yes/No]
        Eligibility: [Eligible/Not Eligible]
        Lineup Decision: [Decision]
        Final Decision: [Play/Rest]

        In summary, this program simulates a real-world decision-making
        process for team selection, combining variables, type casting,
        operators, selection statements, switch cases, nested ifs, and
        the ternary operator into one big system.
